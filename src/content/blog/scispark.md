## Introducing: SciSpark

### Education Education Education

Tony Blair's famous phrase "education, education, education"[^1] from the 00s has long been a message that resonates across parties and individuals. But what does that look like in today's challenging times? Before I dive deeper, it's important to remember that once the calculator was a feared device in classrooms, and teachers sought to eliminate it. However, after the initial fear subsided, it became common practice, almost a fashion statement, in classrooms[^2]. I use this example to draw parallels with AI, where current generative models give it a far wider scope of subjects. We are, therefore, back at a starting point.

For civilizations to thrive successfully, they must be supported by the youth, who are the backbone and the future leaders. This is best measured through a combination of employability and education. In the UK, the number of pupils in state-funded nurseries and secondary schools slightly increased by 0.2% and 1.6% respectively from 2021/22 to 2022/23, while primary school enrollments decreased by 0.3%[^3]. 

Additionally, as of April to June 2023, 11.6% of 16–24-year-olds in the UK were not in education, employment, or training (NEET)[^3], highlighting a gap in transitioning to employment post-education, pales in comparison to our G7 counterparts. Additionally, The value of higher education has changed significantly for each generation and for companies too who are starting to make a shift alternative routes through apprenticeships. In this fourth industrial revolution, I propose companies are also focusing on enterprise people planning(similar to enterpise resource planning), and it's crucial. We at SciSpark are already working to evolve the future generations for what could create a gap but instead we are focused on not only making students become valuable members of society but also highly skilled and resilient

### Students are not some parrot to regurgitate random facts 

The current education system measures only a fraction of what "education" or "intelligence" is. Despite millions of years of evolution, we did not advance by successfully reciting algebraic formulas as if they were some magical incantation. Instead, we aggregated knowledge from a variety of experiences from our predecessors, which helped to create life-saving behaviors and instincts. I want to highlight two points: first, our learning experience from birth has always been very personal, primarily a one-on-one interaction with our parents for the first 36+ months. This changes drastically with formal schooling, which is by definition a group setting. 

The point I am making is that the one-on-one interaction bond is lost, which interestingly enough is realised much later by parents when they then get tutors. The "Bloom's Two Sigma"[^4] study demonstrated that an average student, with personal tuition, performs two standard deviations above a classroom student. This suggests a strong justification for the one-on-one approach. However, since the average teacher-to-student ratio in the UK for 2022/23 18(approx more than 10 million plus students in the UK)[^5], this approach is not feasible. This is where software can help, becoming widely available at our fingertips. SciSpark aims to become this learning management system that not only provides access to the Bloom's Two Sigma effect but also prepares students for the future.

### Shaping the Future of Education

At the very core of SciSpark are the students who use the product. Not the models, not the data we are a people first company and believe in putting their interests first.

### Feature Deep Dive

SciSpark's features include the use of the RAG framework, a tutor and student portal, and XR (Extended Reality). We are testing the use of visionOS for developing novel ways in which VR and Hologram technology can be available to all children.

Here is a demo video [SciSpark](https://www.loom.com/share/6cc8cb382cb74b69be8c78b9c8d909f6?sid=5b0b22d0-f066-434f-8fac-25dab1b28b9c)

Note: While we have been approached on multiple occasions for funding, we currently have no interest in external investments. Should this change, we will notify interested parties.
