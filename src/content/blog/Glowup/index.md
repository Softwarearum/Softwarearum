## Introducing: Glow Up

**GlowUp** was started with the idea to bring back the **"party/magic"** that was first felt in the early days of the internet. It truly felt like anything was possible. Over the years, this magic has been lost, and **Gen Z** has increasingly fallen out of love with the internet. Having a love-hate relationship, **less than a third** of Gen Z said they **post at least once a day** due to anxiety, yet **54% of Gen Zers said they spend at least four hours daily on social media**, consuming more than they create.

### The Social Glow 

GlowUp is bringing back the magic within Gen Z. By equipping creators with cutting-edge tools and advocating for a culture of creation over consumption, GlowUp seeks to emulate the philospher Immanuel Kant's principle of _treating individuals with dignity and respect empowering them as ends in themselves, rather than mere means._

### Unleshing Your Imagination

This Replicate tutorial of a popular AI API service that got 3.7 million views. However, most of the comments were frustrated by just how difficult, time consuming and non-techie friendly the experience was by the comments...

I quickly put together a quick MVP and then made a video about it on TikTok, which got over 30,000 views. It attracted 1,100 users with a CTR of 86% and saved users 10 minutes of time, all in just 24 hours.

However, this success unveiled a broader issue: the absence of user-friendly content augmentation tools, posing a significant barrier to non-technical creators. Motivated by this realization, I am committed to addressing this systemic challenge on a larger scale, letting any content creator regardless of thier technical know have access to these tools, think the Canva of augmented generated content.
